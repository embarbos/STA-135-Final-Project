# air-pollution-data-analysis
Hello!

This was a final group project for my STA 135 Class at UC Davis, taught by Dr. Xiucai Ding. For this project, we applied boxplots, scatterplots, principle component analysis, and multiple linear regression to air pollution data. Using these techniques, we concluded from the data that days of precipitation and presence of negative temperatures were the most important factors for a city's polution level. In this repository, I have included the raw R Markdown file and the knitted .pdf file.

Thank you!
